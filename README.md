# ChaosGame
The chaos game is an experiment with creating something out of completely random selection. Sort of. We are using a consistent formula the whole time.

# Usage
1. Click on the Chaos Game window to place vertices of a shape. 
2. You can place as many as you want. 
3. When you are finished creating your shape press enter and then place your last point. 
4. The program will start generating points within the shape and hopefully a fractal will show up!

# Options
No repeat: Press 'N' to force the program to not choose the same vertice twice in a row when selecting a random vertice. Try making a square with this option enabled.
